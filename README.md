# KATWare
GUI For the Roblox Game KAT! If you would like to paste these scripts into your own cheat, make sure to leave credit to the original owner.

## Information
You will need a executor for Roblox to run this script.

Q: Can I Edit This Script 

A: Yes, you can.

This script will not get you banned.

One of my accounts has been up to Level 170+ with this script!

If you prefer to use the loadstring, here it is: loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cOpEtriNe/Katware-/main/Script'))()

If you want the old ui, copy the code and put into ur hax
